# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The server is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and serves as the foundation for managing users and clothing items. This project covers setting up the Express server, connecting it to a MongoDB database, configuring routes and controllers, and implementing basic error handling. Future stages will add security features, user authorization, and deployment.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
